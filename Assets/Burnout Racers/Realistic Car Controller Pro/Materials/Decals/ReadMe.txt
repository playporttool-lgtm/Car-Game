These materials have a decal shader built for URP and HDRP. This shader is not compatible with builtin render pipeline. To use decal and neon shaders, URP or HDRP must be installed.

For URP and HDRP projects, be sure to add renderer feature to the render pipeline asset. More info can be found in the documentation.
